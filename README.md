## Who I am
👋 Greetings, I am a **data science intern** at Evraz North America while pursuing a **MSc** in **Data Science** at **DePaul University**.  

## Skills
🌱 I have classroom and personal experience with **Python**, **SQL**, **R** and **PL/SQL** among others. I have implemented various **machine learning** algorithms in R and Python such as linear/logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, ensemble methods, support vector machines and clustering (among other unsupervised learning techniques). Familiar libraries include **Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, Tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)**. Knowledgable **multivariate analyses** include techniques such as Factor Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, PCA, LDA, and CCA. More recently, I've become acquainted with various big data technologies within Apache **Hadoop**'s software framework such as  **Hive, Pig, HBase, Mahout, Storm, Spark** in Linux via Amazon's EC2 service. Various visualizations have been created using Microsoft **Power BI** and **Tableau**. 

## Experience
🕐 I am a **data science intern** at Evraz North America, completing various analyses and dashboards for the procurement team. Recently, I completed a **data analytics internship** at the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) cleaning databases and generating internal inventory reports. I have previous experience as a mathematics tutor for Huntington Learning Center where I prepared high school students for the ACT/SAT while tutoring specific math and science subjects as needed. In addition, I have worked as an inside sales consultant for HomeAdvisor, providing sales strategy and support to leadership and team members.

## Education
🏫 In June 2023, I will receive a MSc in Data Science from **DePaul Univeristy** with a concentration in Computational Methods. I received a BA in Economics from **Vanderbilt University** with a minor in Chemistry in 2017.

## Relevant Courswork
📚 Statistics and Data Analysis, Tools and Techniques for Computational Analysis, Python Programming, Fundamentals of Data Science, Data Analysis and Regression I & II, Data Visualization, Programming Machine Learning Algorithms, Database Processing for Large-Scale Analytics, Database Programming, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Intelligent Information Retrieval, Mining Big Data, Advanced Machine Learning

## Interests
👀 In my personal time, I read about **sports analytics** that pertain to football, basketball, baseball and their respective American professional leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB). I also enjoy visiting art galleries, attending music concerts, and playing FIFA 23 (videogame).
